@check(
    id="com.google.fonts/check/kern_table",
    rationale="""
        Even though all fonts should have their kerning implemented in the GPOS table,
        there may be kerning info at the kern table as well.

        Some applications such as MS PowerPoint require kerning info on the kern table.
        More specifically, they require a format 0 kern subtable from a kern table
        version 0 with only glyphs defined in the cmap table, which is the only one
        that Windows understands (and which is also the simplest and more limited
        of all the kern subtables).

        Google Fonts ingests fonts made for download and use on desktops, and does
        all web font optimizations in the serving pipeline (using libre libraries
        that anyone can replicate.)

        Ideally, TTFs intended for desktop users (and thus the ones intended for
        Google Fonts) should have both KERN and GPOS tables.

        Given all of the above, we currently treat kerning on a v0 kern table
        as a good-to-have (but optional) feature.
