              specific failure condition. A short string is preferred, it
              makes a better experience to read the code.
              Never use the same code at two different yields, this is meant
              for unit testing to identify a specific condition of the check.
              A yield within a loop would (usually) have the same code for
              each iteration, unless there's a good reason not to do so.

        In the future, this class could be extended to hold even more
        information if useful, e.g. a hint how to fix a specific condition.
