            Never use the same code at two different yields, this is meant
            for unit testing to identify a specific condition of the check.
            A yield within a loop would (usually) have the same code for
            each iteration, unless there's a good reason not to do so.

      information if useful, e.g. a hint how to fix a specific condition.
