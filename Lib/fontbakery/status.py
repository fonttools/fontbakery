# Status messages of the check runner protocol

# Structuring statuses
#  * begin with "START" and "END"
#  * have weights < 0
#  * START statuses have even weight, corresponding END statuses have odd
#    weights, such that START.weight + 1 == END.weight
#  * the bigger the weight the bigger is the structure, structuring on a macro-level
#  * different structures can have the same weights, if they occur on the same level
#  * ENDCHECK is the biggest structuring status
#
# Log statuses
#  * have weights >= 0
#  * the more important the status the bigger the weight
#  * ERROR has the biggest weight
#  * PASS is the lowest status a check can have,
#    i.e.: a check run must at least yield one log that is >= PASS
#
# From all the statuses that can occur within a check, the "worst" one
# is defining for the check overall status:
# ERROR > FAIL > WARN > INFO > SKIP > PASS > DEBUG
# Anything from WARN to PASS does not make a check fail.
# A result < PASS creates an ERROR. That means, DEBUG is not a valid
# result of a check, nor is any of the structuring statuses.
# A check with SKIP can't (MUST NOT) create any other event.

# Log statuses
# only between STARTCHECK and ENDCHECK:
DEBUG = Status("DEBUG", 0)  # Silent by default
PASS = Status("PASS", 1)
SKIP = Status(
    "SKIP", 2
)  # SKIP is heavier than PASS because it's likely more interesting to
# see what got skipped, to reveal blind spots.
INFO = Status("INFO", 3)
WARN = Status(
    "WARN", 4
)  # A check that results in WARN may indicate a problem, but also may be OK.
FAIL = Status("FAIL", 5)  # A FAIL is a problem detected in the font or family.
ERROR = Status(
    "ERROR", 6
)  # Something a programmer must fix. It will make a check fail as well.

# Start of the suite of checks. Must be always the first message, even in async mode.
# Message is the full execution order of the whole profile
START = Status("START", -6)
# Only between START and before the first SECTIONSUMMARY and END
# Message is None.
STARTCHECK = Status("STARTCHECK", -2)
# Ends the last check started by STARTCHECK.
# Message the the result status of the whole check, one of PASS, SKIP, FAIL, ERROR.
ENDCHECK = Status("ENDCHECK", -1)
# After the last ENDCHECK one SECTIONSUMMARY for each section before END.
# Message is a tuple of:
#   * the actual execution order of the section in the check runner session
#     as reported. Especially in async mode, the order can differ significantly
#     from the actual order of checks in the session.
#   * a Counter dictionary where the keys are Status.name of
#     the ENDCHECK message. If serialized, some existing statuses may not be
#     in the counter because they never occurred in the section.
SECTIONSUMMARY = Status("SECTIONSUMMARY", -3)
# End of the suite of checks. Must be always the last message, even in async mode.
# Message is a counter as described in SECTIONSUMMARY, but with the collected
# results of all checks in all sections.
