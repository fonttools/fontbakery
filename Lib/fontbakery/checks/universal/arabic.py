        Unicode has a few spacing symbols representing Arabic dots and other marks,
        but they are purposefully not classified as marks.

        Many fonts mistakenly classify them as marks, making them unsuitable
        for their original purpose as stand-alone symbols to used in pedagogical
        contexts discussing Arabic consonantal marks.

        Many fonts incorrectly treat ARABIC LETTER HIGH HAMZA (U+0675) as a variant of
        ARABIC HAMZA ABOVE (U+0654) and make it a combining mark of the same size.

        But U+0675 is a base letter and should be a variant of ARABIC LETTER HAMZA
        (U+0621) but raised slightly above baseline.

        Not doing so effectively makes the font useless for Jawi and
        possibly Kazakh as well.
