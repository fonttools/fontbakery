        COLR v0 fonts are widely supported in most browsers so they do not require
        an SVG color table. However, some environments (e.g. Safari, Adobe apps)
        do not currently support COLR v1 so we need to add an SVG table to these fonts,
        except in the case of variable fonts, since SVG does not support
        OpenType Variations.

        To automatically generate compatible SVG/COLR tables,
        run the maximum_color tool in nanoemoji:

@check(

    rationale="""
        Layers of a COLRv0 font should not be too dark or too bright. When layer colors
        are set explicitly, they can't be changed and they may turn out illegible
        against dark or bright backgrounds.

        While traditional color-less fonts can be colored in design apps or CSS, a
        black color definition in a COLRv0 font actually means that that layer will be
        rendered in black regardless of the background color. This leads to text
        becoming invisible against a dark background, for instance when using a dark
        theme in a web browser or operating system.

        This check ensures that layer colors are at least 10% bright and at most 90%
        bright, when not already set to the current color (0xFFFF).
