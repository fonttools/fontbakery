# FIXME: reimplement this addressing the actual root cause of the issue.

@check(
    id="com.google.fonts/check/negative_advance_width",
    rationale="""
        Advance width values in the Horizontal Metrics (htmx) table cannot be negative
        since they are encoded as unsigned 16-bit values. But some programs may infer
        and report a negative advance by looking up the x-coordinates of the glyphs
        directly on the glyf table.

        There are reports of broken versions of Glyphs.app causing this kind of problem
        as reported at [1] and [2].

        This check detects and reports such malformed glyf table entries.
