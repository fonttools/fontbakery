    <p>The Type Network fontQA process strives to ensure that your
    fonts work in and for the various applications, browsers, and
    platforms as expected by our customers. TN’s fontQA also ensures
    that the binary data meets current technical specifications
    (e.g. OpenType Specification) and follows best practices we have
    put in place to produce consistent, high quality pieces of
    software—your fonts!</p>
    <p>These checks have been carefully put together by TN staff,
    taken from the various existing Font Bakery profiles and adding
    new ones of our own. Some checks have been edited to meet TN’s
    requirements. This means we may have relaxed the requirement
    or vice versa. We have tried to include a rationale with each and
    how to address the issue when reported as a FAIL or a WARN.
    Of course, if you have any questions, please ask; we are here to
    help you.</p>
