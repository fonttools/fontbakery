# These are the very few font families where we accept usage of
# a Reserved Font Name. These are typically fonts that had already
# been published previously with an RFN, or fonts which benefit from
# an agreement with Google Fonts.
#
# For now we'll leave this empty because the
# actual long list of familynames we had here
# still needs to be more carefully reviewed.
