FONTLOG for the ABeeZee font

This file provides detailed information on the ABeeZee
font Software.

Basic Font Information

ABeeZee was designed by Anja Meiners.

ABeeZee is a children's learning font. Open, friendly and simple but definite
shapes support the learning process of reading and writing. As a second step,
ABeeZee italic carefully leads to a more fluent writing movement and to an own
unique handwriting.

ABeeZee is a Unicode typeface that supports 
languages that use the Latin script and its variants, and 
could be expanded to support other scripts.

More specifically, this release supports the following 
Unicode ranges: Latin-1

For each style there are three .VFB Source files:
1. Family-Style.vfb (Original Source file with contour overlaps)
2. Family-Style-OTF.vfb (Merged contours and optimized file 
                         corresponding to the OTF file)
3. Family-Style-TTF.vfb (TrueType outlines with hinting 
                         adjustments corresponding to the TTF file)
